**Welcome to KDE Connect iOS 2021's Testing Repository!**

This project is inteded to be the iOS version of the group of applications called KDE Connect, which uses LAN network to integrate devices together, for information on KDE Connect, check out:

This project is a continuation of KDE Connect 2014, a codebase that stemmed from the Google Summer of Code 2014 program that remained largely untouched since 2014 until getting picked up by Inoki (https://invent.kde.org/wxiao) in 2019, where some tweaks were added to it to support TLS.

KDE Connect 2021 started as a project for Google Summer of Code 2021 by student Lucas Wang. As of mid August 2021, the app compiles and is able to perform all of the functionalities currently implemented (though there are likely some bugs to be found). Currently, the app is not yet ready for Release distribution as there lacks certain functionalities compared to the other KDE Connect versions that either need to be implemented or are likely unviable to implement due to iOS restrictions.

Lucas will be continuing development of the project with mentors Inoki (https://invent.kde.org/wxiao) and Philip (https://invent.kde.org/philipc), the easiest place to reach them is the KDE Connect development Telegram channel (https://planet.kde.org/t.me/joinchat/AOS6gA37orb2dZCLhqbZjg). Search their names and they should come up.

A couple useful information to get started if you would like to know more about the project:

https://lucaswangzx.xyz/kde_list contains many articles by Lucas covering technical overviews of this project as well as its origin and plans for the future.
